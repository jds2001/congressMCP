"""Guards for the §17 harness's own invariants (tests/e2e/run_suite.py).

§17 names the central hazard: "automation is the easiest place to silently violate the
method." A harness that batches prompts, appends a diagnostic instruction, or lets a
crashed invocation read as a consumer that made no calls produces numbers that look
like §17 and measure something else -- and it does so while printing a clean table.

Each invariant below is asserted to FIRE, because an invariant that cannot fail is
decoration. The manifest's own integrity is checked too: criteria pinned before the run
are this section's preregistration-of-scoring rule, so a prompt missing them would let
scoring be invented after the result is seen.
