## Search Tips
- Use lowercase when searching: "hr", "s", "hjres", etc.
- Bills and Joint Resolutions become law if signed by the President
- Resolutions express Congressional opinion or set internal rules
- Constitutional amendments use Joint Resolutions but don't require Presidential signature

## API Usage
When using the Bills API tools, specify bill types using these exact codes:
`hr`, `s`, `hjres`, `sjres`, `hconres`, `sconres`, `hres`, `sres`

3. Assigned bill number
4. Referred to committee(s)

### **Stage 2: Committee Review**
1. Committee consideration
2. Hearings (optional)
3. Markup sessions
4. Committee vote
5. Report to full chamber

### **Stage 3: Floor Action**
1. Placed on calendar
2. Floor debate
3. Amendments considered
4. Final passage vote

### **Stage 4: Other Chamber**
1. Received from first chamber

## Status Interpretation Tips

### **Active Bills**
- Look for recent action dates

- Committee activity indicates ongoing work

### **Stalled Bills**
- No recent actions (6+ months)
- Stuck in committee
- End of Congress approaching

### **Dead Bills**
- Failed vote
- End of Congress (bills die if not passed)
- Withdrawn by sponsor

## Search Strategy
- Use `get_bill_actions` for complete legislative history
- Check `latestAction` for current status
- Recent `updateDate` indicates active consideration
- Multiple chambers in actions = bill progressing

    Returns information about search strategies, parameter combinations,

    """
    return """# Bills API Usage Guide & Best Practices

## Search Strategies

### **1. Direct Bill Lookup**
**Best for**: Known bill numbers
```
get_bill_details(bill_id="HR 1, 119th Congress")
search_bills("congress:119 billtype:hr docnumber:1")
```
- For a known bill number use get_bill_details with bill_id
- The fielded search_bills form returns exactly that bill's versions

### **2. Keyword Search (full-text corpus)**
**Best for**: Topic- or name-based research
```
search_bills("infrastructure permitting", congress=119, limit=20)
search_bills("climate change", bill_type="hr")
```
- Searches the FULL TEXT of every bill version (GovInfo BILLS corpus)
- Words are ANDed; do NOT quote bill names (use title:"..." for exact titles)
- Combine with Congress/type filters

### **3. Targeted Filtering**
**Best for**: Focused research
```
search_bills("healthcare", congress=119, bill_type="hr", limit=10)
```
- Combine multiple filters for precision
- Use recent Congress numbers (118, 119)
- Limit results to manageable numbers

## Parameter Optimization

### **Congress Numbers**
- **Current Research**: Use 119 (current) or 118 (recent)
- **Recent Research**: Use 118 (2023-2024) 
- **Historical**: Use 103+ for comprehensive data
- **Avoid**: Very old Congress numbers (<100) unless necessary

### **Bill Types**
- **All Legislation**: Don't specify (searches all types)
- **Major Bills**: Use "hr" or "s" 
- **Resolutions**: Use "hres", "sres", "hconres", "sconres"
- **Constitutional**: Use "hjres", "sjres"

### **Limits & Sorting**
- **Default Limit**: 10 results (good starting point)
- **Research**: 20-50 results for comprehensive review
- **search_bills**: relevance-ranked; no sort parameter (walk
  next_page_token for more)
- **get_bills**: updateDate+desc (most recent first) or updateDate+asc

## Effective Research Workflows
