"""Bill text retrieval service: the §10 freshness table, then serve from the
persistent cache or fetch-parse-build-publish.

| Situation | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Explicit ``version=``, index cached | Serve from cache with no network. Revalidate only if ``now - created_at > CONGRESSMCP_REVALIDATE_DAYS``: fetch the GovInfo package summary, compare ``lastModified``; rebuild if changed. |
| ``version=None``, resolution cached and within ``CONGRESSMCP_VERSION_TTL`` | Use the cached resolution, no network. ``version_resolution: "cached"``, ``cache.version_hit: true``. |
| ``version=None``, TTL expired | Re-resolve via congress.gov (+ GovInfo package summary). |
| ``version=None``, network unavailable | Use the last successful resolution. ``version_resolution: "cached_offline"`` with ``version_resolved_at`` disclosed in ``version_resolution_note``. |
| ``version=None``, no cached resolution, no network | Error ``version_resolution_unavailable``, listing any cached versions of that bill. |
| Package reissued under the same id (``lastModified`` changed) | Discard and rebuild the index. |

Then the index: on a hit open the published file read-only (``cache.index_hit``
true, no parse); on a miss download, parse, build into a temp file,
close-and-validate, publish atomically (loser adopts), and serve the PUBLISHED
file; if the store cannot produce a servable file, serve an in-memory index --
the cache never fails the user's call. ``CONGRESSMCP_CACHE_ENABLED=false``
skips the store entirely: in-memory index, discarded per call, full re-fetch
and re-parse every time (§10 tunables).

Timing (§9): ``resolve_ms`` covers congress.gov resolution plus the GovInfo
package summary; ``download_ms`` the XML download; ``parse_ms``/``index_ms``
the parse and build. Each is null when that leg did not run.
