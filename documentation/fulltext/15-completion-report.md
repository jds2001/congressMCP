# 16. Completion report — PR 1

> **Status 2026-08-20: FINAL.** Four items remain open and are named under *Gates* at the end — two owed confirmations (F16; F31's live keyless check), one maintainer requirements call (#17), and Group F's sourcing gap. **None blocks merge under §17's stated rule** (a Group A failure blocks; Group A passed 16/16 in all four cells). It is laid out against the spec's own enumerations — every V-step by number, every amendment by number, every §16 question by name, every defect by F-number — so a gap renders as a blank `[ ]`, never as prose that reads complete. Every descriptive claim about runtime behaviour is stamped with the commit or measurement it rests on (`00-INDEX`); the spec author cannot read the source, so numbers come from V-steps and reported artifacts, never from familiarity. Figures attributed to the implementation session are marked *(reported)* where they were not independently re-derived here.

### Full-text search and retrieval for congressional bills

**What this adds.** Three tools — `search_bill_text`, `get_bill_section`, `get_bill_toc` — that search and read **the actual text of a bill**, with its structure intact (division → title → subtitle → section → subsection), resolving the right version automatically.

**What it buys you that you didn't have.** The existing ~93 tools return metadata *about* bills — sponsors, actions, committee history, summaries, and a link to the text. To answer *"what does this bill actually say about X,"* someone had to open the document; the FY2026 NDAA is 9.36 MB of XML. These tools answer that question directly, in **3.88 s cold** on that same bill.

The part that matters most is not search — it is **not being confidently wrong**. Bills are mostly *amendments to other law*: the text is full of quoted blocks the bill is inserting into, or striking from, the U.S. Code. A plain full-text search over a bill happily returns a hit sitting inside one of those blocks, and reporting it as "what the bill requires" is a wrong answer with **no tell** — it reads exactly like a right one. This is not a rare corner: measured at hit level, **29.2% of matches are quoted-only** (V21) — nearly a third of what a naive search returns is text the bill does not enact.

So every match carries `match_contexts` (`operative` / `quoted` / `header`), and every response carries `is_amendatory` and `amends` **describing the text actually returned** — including a section assembled from amendatory subsections, verified against the whole corpus with zero mismatches over 3,216 conformance calls. That is how a consumer tells

> *"the bill requires an inventory of not less than 478 aircraft"* (wrong)

from

> *"the bill amends 10 U.S.C. § 9062(j) to require 478 aircraft in FY2027"* (right).

That distinction is the feature. The same machinery also excludes **committee-struck text** in reported versions — text a committee *removed*, which a naive parse would return as current — and discloses the exclusion rather than hiding it.

**Why the diff is this big.** It is a complete subsystem plus its verification apparatus. The product code is a small fraction:

| Part | Files | Added | Share |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Bill-text feature code** | 8 | 3,467 | 20% |
| Tests + E2E harness | 27 | 7,057 | 42% |
| Spec + decision record | 21 | 5,268 | 31% |
| Shared-layer adoption in existing tools | 44 | 1,170 (−321) | 7% |
| **Total as of 2026-08-20** (157 commits) | **65** | **18,467** (−1,592) | |

*(Per-category split measured 2026-08-16; the totals row is re-measured at final — the growth since is the F29–F33 round: cross-vendor harness support, the disclosure-aggregation fix, and the V22 corpus instrument.)*

The 42% is the point, not overhead: bill XML is adversarial (nested quoted blocks, 330 KB single paragraphs, resolutions with no sections, typos enacted *into* the Code), so the feature is pinned by fixtures, a 20-package corpus, and a four-cell end-to-end suite that tests the **consumer** — whether a model reading these responses draws the right conclusion — not just the code.

**How to review it.** Reading `documentation/fulltext/06-segments-amendatory.md` first is worth ten minutes: the segment model is the load-bearing decision and everything else follows from it. Then, in order of attention:

1. `parser.py` (1,115) — XML → addressable units + segments. The riskiest file; the amendatory/struck-text/chunking logic lives here.
2. `tools.py` (875) — the three tool surfaces and response shapes (spec §4/§9).
3. `client.py` (620) — fetch and version resolution (spec §3); 53 GPO version codes ranked by authority, not date.
4. `index.py` (306) — FTS5 (porter) + RRF fusion, `k=60`.
5. `trace.py` (310) — out-of-band instrumentation used by the E2E suite; off unless `CONGRESSMCP_TRACE_DIR` is set.

`models.py`/`service.py`/`__init__.py` are small. Tests and the spec files can be skimmed unless a specific claim is in question.

**What's verified.** 22 acceptance steps (V1–V22) run live against real APIs, not fixtures; bill-text suite **167 passed** *(reported)*. The end-to-end suite ran across four Claude cells — attention floor (Sonnet, crowded context), reasoning ceiling (Opus, fresh), capability floor (Haiku), and an isolated cell where only these three tools are registered so every claim is attributable — **70 prompt runs**. The gating group (the amendatory-trap prompts) passed **16/16 across all four cells**, including at the capability floor.

A fifth, **cross-vendor cell** (GPT-5.6 via the Codex CLI, non-gating by design) then measured how the tools survive a consumer nobody tuned for. Result worth stating: **every disclosure that reached that consumer was read correctly** — struck text, quoted-name traps, incompleteness — at that vendor's floor tier; and the exercise surfaced two real defects the Claude cells structurally could not have found (Claude reconstructs the amendatory frame from raw statutory text, masking a missing schema field): a disclosure absent from one response path, and assembled responses mislabeling amendatory content. Both are fixed and verified corpus-wide — **3,216 conformance calls, zero mismatches** — and the whole chain (six adjudicated runs, a measured "danger ladder" of consumption modes, two preregistered experiments) is in `documentation/fulltext/12-e2e-prompts.md`.

**Reproducing the verification, and what it costs.** The unit and corpus layers need only Python and the two upstream API keys (GovInfo / congress.gov — free). The end-to-end suite has **pre-existing software requirements: the Claude Code CLI** (drives the four Claude cells) **and the Codex CLI** (drives the cross-vendor cells). Practical notes from running it: the full Claude-cell suite is 70 prompts, and the maintainer's experience is that a **Claude Max 5x plan** is needed to complete it — 70 prompts appears to exceed a Pro plan's 5-hour usage window (believed from use, not precisely measured). Reproducing the `gpt-5.6-luna` cross-vendor runs **without web grounding** requires an **OpenAI API key**, billed at native API rates — the harness configures a custom no-web model provider so the results are attributable to the tools rather than to web search. Notably, the OpenAI models appear to favor web grounding and not adopt the tools unless web grounding is explicitly disabled.

**Further verification is welcome — especially Group F.** This feature has had unusually heavy verification (the tables in documentation/fulltext/15-completion-report.md), but its one honestly open gap is **real questions from people who have never read this spec or code**: every prompt in the suite was written by someone who knew where the bodies were buried, which measures the known traps and not the unknown ones. If you use these tools, verbatim questions — asked exactly as you'd naturally ask them, ideally with the answer you expected — are the single most valuable contribution, and there is a ready slot for them (§17 Group F). The harness itself (`tests/e2e/`) is deliberately not bill-text-specific — manifest-driven prompts with pre-pinned pass/fail criteria, per-cell out-of-band tracing, canary liveness checks, cold per-prompt working directories — and **could be extended to verify the other ~93 tools the same way**. If this is desired, extending the out-of-band tracing mechanism to the other tools would be required.

**Where that evidence lives, and how to re-derive it.** The raw run artifacts (`runs/`) and the fetched corpus bytes (`tests/corpus/cache/`) are **deliberately gitignored — they are large, disposable, and reproducible**, so they are not in this diff and there is nothing to review there. What *is* in the diff is the durable record: the analysis of each run in `documentation/fulltext/` (§16 here, §17 in `12-e2e-prompts.md`, defects in `14-defect-priority.md`). That is a large part of why the spec is 31% of the change — **it is the only surviving account of verification whose inputs were thrown away by design.** To re-derive any of it yourself: `tests/corpus/manifest.json` is tracked, so the corpus re-fetches from it (via `tests/corpus/fetch_corpus.py`); the three trimmed XML fixtures under `tests/fixtures/` are in-tree; and the E2E harness under `tests/e2e/` re-runs the prompt suite (set `CONGRESSMCP_TRACE_DIR` for traces).

**What's deliberately deferred to PR 2.** Persistent caching, offline mode, and the disk cap. Today every call re-fetches, re-parses, and re-indexes (**~4.4 s**), so client timeouts should allow for it. The `cache` fields in responses are present but inert.

**Blast radius on existing behaviour.** The new tools are additive. The shared-layer changes are mostly mechanical adoption of a parameter guard across 7 routers, with **one visible change**: the `laws` tools previously accepted an inapplicable parameter and silently ignored it; they now reject it with a clear error. That is the documented contract, but it is a behaviour change on a public tool. The `mcp` dependency is pinned `>=2.0.0,<3`.

**One more thing, offered as useful rather than as criticism.** Driving the new tools end-to-end meant driving the existing surface alongside them, so this work doubled as an unplanned audit of it. Anything found is written up in **`documentation/tool-defect-register.md`** — a standing register, kept separate from this feature and **not a prerequisite for this PR**. It is worth a look because it also records what is *working* and worth protecting with regression tests (the validation error envelopes are unusually complete), and because it keeps the findings that turned out to be **wrong**: of eight items raised by one automated review, three were artifacts of the review tool reading a stale worktree, and they are recorded as refuted with the measurement that killed them, so nobody re-raises them next cycle. Nothing in that register is a regression from this PR.

## B. Amendments (A1–A6)

| # | Spec said | Measured | Changed | Why measurement beat the spec |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | `amends` longhand-only | hr1 14/293 vs shorthand 373× | two-form | reconciliation bills cite USC shorthand |

| A5 | longhand self-anchoring | 411 non-amendment fires | verb-gate all three forms | resolvability ≠ amendatory |
| A6 | split `resolve_ms`/`download_ms` | every PR-1 call cold | ships one `fetch_ms` | split conveys nothing until PR 2 |

## C. §16 questions, by name

- **119hr1 RECA-expansion version** — **`enr`** carries it (V3: 5 hits; `eh` returns 0 hits *with* `sections_indexed`=334, which is the ambiguity-resolution case that field exists for). Independently corroborated in the §17 re-run: the ceiling cell located the enacted expansion at HR 1 §100203/§100205 (P.L. 119-21).
- **`uslmLink` exists / any non-enrolled package carries it** — `enr` yes, `is`/`es`/`eh` no (V1); standing consequence for the Bill-DTD-for-all-versions decision if it ever changes upstream
- **Tokenizer behaviour, concretely** — `porter unicode61 remove_diacritics 2` (V6)
- **Self-sufficiency** — the three tools resolve, fetch, and navigate from `congress`+`bill_type`+`number` alone; `CONGRESSMCP_BILL_TEXT_ONLY` makes it enforceable. A design choice the spec never stated
- **Design choices the spec did not cover** — enumerated rather than gestured at, and now complete: A5's verb gate on all three citation forms; the intro-labelling fix (per-child classification); V17's scoping; struck-text **exclude-and-disclose** (F4); the header-separator glyph **`·`**, chosen on evidence after `—` was measured to collide with the corpus's own em-dash use; **RRF k=60 held** after V20 refuted the concern; the `amends` object-with-`kind` shape; **one disclosure condition, one field** (F17's `request_note` split); **matched-pair-only** delimiter stripping with content preferred over display neatness (F18); the error taxonomy's recoverability split — `congress_unavailable` triggers the GovInfo fallback, `bill_not_found` is definitive and does not (F21); **no secret-bearing URL in an error `detail`** (F22); the CLI exit-code contract (refusal → `1` on both entry points, §10); and **decomposition over enumeration** for version codes — a reissue inherits its base's rank rather than earning a table row (§3, specified but unbuilt, see D)

## D. Defect disposition (F1–F28)

| F | Disposition | Commit |
|---|---|---|
| F1 renr/ath precedence | FIXED | 53-code table, categories |
| F2 trailing-period false negative | FIXED | strip trailing, accept period-form input |
| F3 partial `amends` | RULED + IMPLEMENTED | `833a570` (description) |
| F4 struck reported-version text | RULED + IMPLEMENTED | exclude-and-disclose; `119s4726rs` 33→17 |
| F5 TOC hands out unfetchable ids | FIXED | container resolution |
| F6 passive `match_contexts` | RULED | V21 per-hit note |
| F7 codified-law ≠ bill location | FIXED | `07f3889` |
| F8 `amends` boundary undisclosed | RULED + IMPLEMENTED | `833a570` |
| F9 query semantics undocumented | FIXED | `07f3889` |
| F10 zero-hit no diagnostic | FIXED | `79fe05a` — `query_diagnostics` |
| F11 depth-clamp signal | FIXED | `a52d54a` — `depth_reduced`/`requested_depth`/`toc_note` |
| F12 inline/block join | FIXED | `5a54833` |
| F13 chunk header provenance | CLOSED | measured 0/41,854 from quoted |
| F14 reconstructed TOC ids | FIXED | id carried, not rebuilt |
| F15 API key in INFO logs | FIXED | `1284500` — LogRecord factory |
| F16 `#2` suffix masking substitute | disposition `[ ]` | downstream of F4 — confirm `#2`→0 |

**F17–F28 — the two post-review rounds (2026-08-09 ultrareview, 2026-08-14 code review).** All nine implementation items are fixed, one commit each; two more were measured to be unreachable and deliberately **not** built.

| F | Disposition | Commit / evidence |
|---|---|---|
| F17 clamp note clobbered `version_resolution_note` | FIXED + schema ruling | `35d676f` merge, then `8167124` — dedicated `request_note`; one condition, one field |
| F18 quote delimiters stripped unpaired | FIXED | `449d38b` — matched-pair only; a trailing apostrophe survives into `segments.text`; 0/18 corpus change (latent) |
| F19 subdivided parent not byte-bounded | FIXED | `e17ee04` — parent's own segments now split; `subtree_bytes` conserved; 0/18 inventory change (latent) |
| F20 fallback dropped digit-suffixed version codes | FIXED (path); ranking **NOT BUILT** | `fd4ac5a` — one shared letter-initial pattern on both enumeration paths, which also blocks a real cross-bill packageId collision. The reissue-ranking follow-on is **dead-defensive**: GovInfo returns **zero** for `ih2`/`pcs2`/`enr2`, so no such code exists (§3) |
| F21 unguarded `response.json()` skipped the GovInfo fallback | FIXED | `5dd3c69` — routed through `make_api_request`; resolves #15 (request-counting + cache restored). Fallback-trigger contract now stated in §3, codes in §9 |
| F22 redirect exhaustion returned a closed 3xx as success | FIXED | `cfd459e` — raises `govinfo_unavailable`; generalized §9 rule: **no secret-bearing URL in an error `detail`** (signed CDN targets, the F15 lesson on a new surface) |
| F23 harness scored an un-exercised run as clean | FIXED | `27be6e4` — interpreter pinned to `sys.executable`, startup import probe, non-aborting per-cell zero-trace check. A Haiku carve-out was considered and **withdrawn** (that cell measures disclosure-*reading*, and Haiku did adopt the tools) |
| F24 six bucket tests un-collectable behind a green baseline | FIXED | `880cb53` — the six were verified dead (removed SaaS-tier architecture) and deleted; the guard's `raise` path is now swept over **every live router branch** (84 cases, ≥40 non-vacuity floor), which also closes #18's missing coverage enforcement; baseline single-sourced (#20) |
| F25 version code read from the dict repr | FIXED | `b464957` — reads `formats[].url` by path. The demonstration: a `note` reading *"supersedes …ih"* resolved the item **to `ih`**, the version it supersedes |
| F26 whitespace-collapse re-implemented at four sites | FIXED | `995d3cf` — one shared `parser.collapse_ws`; the test **pins the source scan**, so a re-implementation fails CI even if it matches that day |
| F27 two error systems on one server | **DECISION NEEDED** | §9's envelope is deliberate, so this is cross-server *consistency*, not drift — a maintainer call, not an implementer's |
| F28 version enumeration capped at 20 | **NOT A DEFECT** (measured) | 500-bill sample (250 each, 118th/119th) maxed at **5** versions — 4× margin; dead-defensive, no change |

**Two entries are worth reading as results in their own right.** F20's ranking machinery and F28's pagination guard were both fully specified and then **not built**, because the measurement said the case cannot occur. Recording *"we checked, it does not exist, do not build it"* is the cheapest thing in this document to lose and the most expensive to rediscover.

**F29–F33 — the cross-vendor round (2026-08-19/20).** Three instrument defects and two product defects, all surfaced by pointing a consumer nobody tuned for at the tools. Full adjudications in `12-e2e-prompts.md`; triage in §18.

| F | Disposition | Commit / evidence |
|---|---|---|
| F29 Codex cell died at the approval layer; harness scored the dead cell clean | FIXED + CLOSED | per-driver pre-cell canary; verified working on first live use (`2026-08-19T025509Z`) |
| F30 cell record asserted effects the instrument never verified (web "off" while measurably live) | settled at **effect level** | `openai-noweb` provider — the web tool is never registered, proven in-band; residual: a cell-level `web:` marker in the manifest |
| F31 keyless server wore `govinfo_key_rejected` ("existing key rejected" with no key configured) | FIXED `99ae552` *(reported)* | `api_key_missing`-shaped code; **live keyless verification owed** — one scrubbed-env stdio call, the instrument that found it |
| F32 `BillSectionResponse` carried no amendatory disclosure; the section-direct path is the one that needs it | FIXED `4911603`, **verified live** | cold A1 ×3 split exactly on path (0/2 without the fields, then 2/3 PASS with them, incl. the only section-direct run); spec-caused (§9 never required the fields there) |
| F33 assembled responses returned amendatory text under `is_amendatory: false` | FIXED `fe17fa5`, **verified `668b357`** | V22: the fields now describe the returned text on every assembling path; set-based verify, 3,216 calls, 0 mismatches |

## E. §17 — consumer-layer results

### COMPLETE RE-RUN — `2026-08-15T033553Z`, build `9224726`. The authoritative post-fix measurement.

**Integrity — solid.** Build `9224726` is on-branch and **all nine fixes (F18–F26) are confirmed git-ancestors**; `working_tree_clean: true`; `zero_trace_cell_failures: []` (the F23 guard ran and found no all-zero cell). Four cells exactly per §17 design: floor (Sonnet-5, crowded, full surface), ceiling (Opus-5, fresh, full surface), capability (Haiku, Group A only, single-step), isolation (Sonnet-5, `bill_text_only=true`, A–E — the fully-attributable cell). 70 results. Haiku **adopted the tools** (6 traces / 4 prompts), so the withdrawn F23 Haiku-amendment stays moot. The two per-prompt zero-call cases (F3 floor + ceiling) sit in cells with live siblings → consumer findings, not harness faults — the ratified F23 behavior, working.

**Results by group** (scored against pinned criteria; the four invariants applied to every answer):

- **Group A — 16/16 PASS across all four cells. The merge gate is met.** A1 (478-aircraft amendatory trap) passes everywhere and the **ceiling frame now survives past the first sentence** ("conforms paragraph (2) by striking the old 'below 466' trigger") — the first-run weakness, fixed. A2 (struck "96 A-10" text) and A3 (§804 VAWA) show struck-text/`amends` handling reaching the consumer, **Haiku included**. A4: no cell claims false completeness; ceiling is exemplary (reads text not index, enumerates four completeness caveats). **Isolation A4 verified grounded** — 42 `get_bill_section` reads, every distinctive cite present in the trace; the prior-run A4 fabrication concern does not reproduce on the fully-attributable cell.
- **Group B — PASS (B2/isolation marginal).** The **B1 `CHUNK`-as-enumeration defect is fixed in all three cells** (each cites the enclosing `§3111(a)` / "to be codified at 10 U.S.C. § 6141", none invents an enum or leaks `CHUNK:`). B2/isolation marginal: says "PRE:1 notes…" framed as "whereas clauses" — one word short of the pinned fail "*Section* PRE:1 states…".
- **Group C — all PASS.** C3 shows `depth_reduced: false` / `toc_truncated: false` — **the F11 depth disclosure reaching the consumer**. C1/C2 answer from aggregated subtree sizes without full fetches.
- **Group D — 12 PASS, 3 MARGINAL, 0 FAIL.** **D5 confirms the F2 trailing-period / `ambiguous_section_id` fix reached the consumer** — verified: 0 false "no section matched" negatives, all three cells surface the three "section 804"s (Div. W/X/E) via `get_bill_toc` + 4 section fetches. The old false negative is gone. D4 marginal in all three cells: each resolves "H.R. 1" to the 119th and names it but **none volunteers that the bare reference was ambiguous** — a consumer response-shape gap, not a tool defect (grounding note: no tool-side default).
- **Group E — all 9 PASS.** E3 fetches and names both `rh` and `eh`, reporting a real difference — the version-resolution path. **E2's pre-registered behavior recurs exactly**: ceiling surfaces the `housing`→`hous` stemming caveat, floor drops it — "the context caveat does not survive at the floor," the passive-disclosure prediction, confirmed. No FTS5 operator error in any cell.
- **Group F — INDICATIVE ONLY, and this run cannot close its gap.** The manifest self-flags (`group_f_caveat`) that the six questions were **spec-derived, not verbatim from naive sources, and below the count minimum** — they inherit the adversarial bias the rule exists to exclude. On the four invariants: F1/floor marginal (a confident false-negative on enacted law — grounded only in pending S.243, missing the enacted HR 1 §100203 the ceiling found); the rest pass. **F3/ceiling is UNRESOLVABLE, not a fabrication** — see the correction below. **The Group-F-verbatim gap remains open**; replace with naive-source questions AND run them in isolation before any F finding counts.

**Fixes confirmed reaching the consumer:** F2 (D5, all cells, no false negative) · F11 (C3 depth flags) · the segment/`amends`/struck-text model (Group A, all cells incl. Haiku) · B1 `CHUNK`-as-enum (fixed all cells) · version resolution `rh`/`eh` (E3). This is what the re-run was for: the burndown changed consumer behavior, not just the tests.

**Consumer/model findings (not tool defects — no implementation fix applies):** D4 disambiguation-caveat gap (all cells, no tool-side default to disambiguate a bare bill number across Congresses); synthetic-id leakage (`PRE:`/`S:`) into user-facing answers in the weaker/isolated cells on whereas/resolution prompts (B2, C3) while the ceiling stays clean — the "passive fields depend on the reader" pattern; E2's floor caveat-drop (pre-registered).

> **Correction — F3/ceiling is NOT a confirmed fabrication (my analysis error, 2026-08-15).** F3/ceiling answered "I searched for an FY2026 NDAA to check, but the keyword search returned nothing responsive" with an **empty bill-text trace**. I first recorded this as fabricated tool activity. **Retracted:** F3/ceiling ran `bill_text_only=false` (the full ~96-tool surface), and the trace instruments only the three bill-text tools — so an empty bill-text trace is consistent with a real call to an **untraced congress.gov sibling**. This is the trace-scope-integrity limit already stated in this section (a claim can come from an untraced sibling), which I failed to apply to my own read until the maintainer caught it. **Group F was not run in isolation** (isolation = A–E), so there is no fully-attributable F3 to settle it. Disposition: **unverifiable on this instrument; re-run F3 in isolation if it matters.** No confirmed fabrication appears anywhere in the run.
>
> **Isolation re-run of F3 (maintainer, 2026-08-15) — F3 is clean; the ceiling claim stays an unadjudicable outlier.** Run in the `bill_text_only=true` cell (trace scope == tool surface, so zero calls now *means* zero calls): **zero tool calls, and a sane answer** — *"Which bill are you referring to? … I'll need the specific bill … to pull the exact text."* This is the **correct** response: the bill-text tools require a bill identifier (congress/type/number) and F3 names none, so recognizing that and asking — rather than inventing a bill to search — is right, not a gap. Floor did the same. So F3 is invariant-clean in the attributable cell and is **not a defect**. The ceiling's "I searched for an FY2026 NDAA" is now an outlier against three clean references (floor, isolation, and the expected behavior), but the isolation run cannot reach back to adjudicate a *different* model on the *full* surface — it remains unverifiable, neither confirmed-fabrication nor confirmed-honest, and is left there. *(This was the fifth confident negative finding of mine this cycle to fail scrutiny — F20, F28, the F23 Haiku amendment, the Haiku id-echo, and this; my integrity/grounding **verifications** held, my **defect-flags** did not. Weight accordingly.)*

### Cross-vendor row — `codex/gpt-5.6-luna/medium/iso`, driver codex-cli 0.147.0 — NON-GATING

Its own row per the driver-axis ruling, never folded into a Claude row. Six adjudications (full record: `12-e2e-prompts.md`, cross-vendor subsection):

| Run | Adjudication |
|---|---|
| `2026-08-19T013718Z` | **VOID** — the approval layer cancelled every MCP call and the harness scored the dead cell clean → F29 |
| `2026-08-19T025509Z` | **Realistic-agent-with-web**: 54 in-band web events, 0 MCP calls; web-fed A1 **FAIL** (inserted text presented as enacted) — first evidence the safety property does not survive web-only consumption |
| Sol probe `2026-08-19T031035Z` | Tools **discoverable** on this surface (1/4 cold adoption kills the invisibility branch); adoption stochastic even at flagship; A1 criteria gap ruled (fail binds only when the amendatory frame is absent/subordinated) |
| `2026-08-19T051758Z` clean cell | Web-off at **effect** level; **3/4 PASS tool-fed** — struck-text, quoted-name, and incompleteness disclosures all read correctly at the cross-vendor floor; A1 FAIL by non-adoption → priors fabrication |
| Cold A1 ×3 (2026-08-20) | Adoption **3/3** (the earlier zero was a stochastic draw; Hint rung not owed); content 1/3 — the split is the tool path → **F32** |
| F32 re-run ×3 (2026-08-20) | Fields live in every trace; **2/3 PASS including the only pure section-direct run** — the preregistered case, on the path that was 0/2 without the fields |

**Standing findings from this row:** the **response shape is vindicated at the cross-vendor floor** — everywhere a disclosure was delivered, it was read and acted on correctly, including both traps; **adoption is the failing layer**, stochastic per prompt×run at every tier measured; and the **danger ladder** of consumption modes is measured, safest first: *tool-fed-with-disclosure > tool-fed-frame-dropped > web-fed > priors-fed*. The row is non-gating, but it produced two P0-class fixes (F32/F33) that the Claude cells could not have surfaced — Claude at every tier reconstructs the amendatory frame from raw statutory text, which masked the missing schema fields. That is §17's "do not let a design lean on one vendor's carefulness" rule, cashed out.

### Prior runs (historical)

- **Original runs (pre-fix).** Group A passed in both cells; 13 findings ranked in §18; B1 at the floor made zero calls (F7). **Caveat established 2026-08-09:** these ran on Claude Desktop with web access, and some claims were grounded in web artifacts rather than in these tools — so the prior findings are **not fully attributable** to the tools, and some passes may have been web-propped. Treat them as a cross-reference, not a clean baseline.
- **Re-run — first run executed `2026-08-09T062714Z`, build `9e119f9`; PARTIAL.** Floor (`claude-sonnet-5`) + ceiling (`claude-opus-5`), Groups A–F, 48 results, 0 harness failures, all `cold_cwd` temp, built-ins off. **Valid cold run, but NOT fully attributable:** both cells ran the full ~96-op congress surface with only the three bill-text tools instrumented, so a claim can come from an untraced sibling tool. Per-claim salvage confirmed for A1/A2/A3 (pinned claims present in the bill-text trace); A4 (fabrication check) cannot be audited until the trace is complete. **Owed: the isolation cell (`bill_text_only=true`)** — the only fully-attributable configuration (§17 surface correction) — before recording "the tool carried the property" or any fabrication verdict. Group F is DERIVED, not verbatim (manifest `group_f_caveat`), so it is weak evidence. Preregistration asymmetry stands: a prior pass the re-run fails is a trace-inspection trigger, not an automatic regression.
- **Isolation cell executed `2026-08-09T154646Z`, build `2ec66c5`; Group A, fully attributable.** `bill_text_only=1`, `claude-sonnet-5`, fresh; A1–A4. **Instrument certified:** every trace call is one of the three tools (get_bill_section 37 / get_bill_toc 5 / search_bill_text 4), all `cold_cwd` temp, 0 harness failures — trace scope == tool surface. **A1/A2/A3 tool-attributable** (load-bearing claims in the trace). **A4:** the model bypassed the `amends` field (which the tools populated richly — 95 distinct targets in-trace) and did a 31-section read-through, then claimed the list is *"complete for Division G"* — which touches the pinned FAIL condition ("presents the list as complete") on a path the criterion did not anticipate (its own read-through, not `amends`).
  - **A4 fabrication audit — DONE, PASSES (2026-08-09).** Detector validated first (6 planted-good cites resolve via structured `amends`; 5 planted-bad come back unsupported — it bites). On the real answer: **93 distinct (title, section) cites parsed, 0 with no support anywhere in the trace** — 25 via structured `amends`, 68 via phrase-level "section N of title T … is amended" co-occurrence. The two citations the **prior** run fabricated — `14 U.S.C. 502` and `46 U.S.C. 4701` — are both **genuinely trace-grounded here** (rec 11: *"chapter 5 of title 14 … is amended— in section 502"*; rec 20: *"Chapter 47 of title 46 … is amended— in section 4701"*), as are the collision-zone `46 U.S.C. 7315/7116`. **No fabrications found** — a real improvement over the prior run, attributable to the fix round, on a fully-attributable instrument. *Residuals:* ~62 of the 68 co-occurrence-supported cites were not individually eyeballed (the 6 highest-risk were, all genuine); the audit checks target existence, not correct subsection/action.
  - **Capability floor (Haiku, `2026-08-09T172014Z`): PASSES the criterion — errs safe.** `claude-haiku-4-5`, single-step variant, **2 calls** (can't afford the ceiling's 31), so it relied on the tool and answered: *"No, this likely isn't all of them"* — citing the F3/F8 convenience caveat **by name** and independently catching the `max_hits=50` truncation. This confirms the hypothesis: A4's intended over-trust test fires at the capability floor, and the disclosure holds at the **weakest tier** (the strongest form of the result — no reasoning required). *Caveats:* the cell ran `bill_text_only=false` (full surface, **not** fully attributable), so the *criterion* PASS is solid (content-based) but the section list's accuracy is uncertified; and the single-step prompt pre-directed the search. n=1.
  - **Disposition DEFERRED to PR2 (decision 2026-08-09).** The "did more work than I wanted" concern — the 31-call read-through and the completeness over-claim — is **cost-contingent**: it only matters if the calls are expensive. PR1 has no cache (~4.4 s/call; A4 ceiling ran 408 s), so over-work is costly *now*; **PR2 caching sets the real per-call cost, and if cached calls are cheap the read-through is fine — arguably the right behavior (verify rather than trust an incomplete `amends`).** So the A4-criterion rework / re-scope-to-floor question waits until PR2 measures that cost. **What does not defer:** the fabrication audit passed on a fully-attributable instrument, and the F3/F8 tool-description property held — the model understood `amends` might be incomplete, which is *why* it verified. **A4 removed as a merge blocker; it is a PR2 open question.**

## F. Measured profile

- Cold **3.88 s** on a large enrolled bill (V2); **~4.4 s/call**, full re-index every call — no cache in PR 1. Client-timeout implication belongs in the README (§12).
- Rate limits independent — indexing cannot starve congress.gov tools (V12).
- **Consumer-side cost, from the §17 re-run** (`2026-08-15T033553Z`): a deep read-through is expensive without a cache — A4 at the ceiling ran **42 `get_bill_section` calls / ~703 KB of tool responses** to enumerate Division G. That is the behaviour PR 2's cache economics decide; it is recorded here as the pre-cache baseline PR 2 has to improve on, not as a defect.
- Corpus scale for the latent-defect checks: **18–20 packages**, 19,234 units; three of the nine fixes (F18, F19, F26) changed **zero** bytes on real data — latent, and caught before they were live.

## G. Stated limitations and boundaries

- `amends` resolves U.S. Code and Public Law only, **never named Acts** (incl. IRC by bare section); convenience, not completeness; populated = citations *found*, not *present*.
- `is_amendatory` is verb-only; ~1% amendatory residual uses no recognised verb, retrievable via `match_contexts=['quoted']`.
- `is_amendatory`/`amends` on `get_bill_section` **describe the returned text** (F32/F33): an assembled response aggregates over the units whose text is included; a descriptor-only response reports the addressed unit's own values (`false`/`[]` for containers). Verified set-based over the corpus, 0 mismatches.
- Committee-struck text excluded and disclosed via `struck_text_note`; recoverable as the prior version.
- Header→body operative run-on (`Quorum.A majority`) — 2-instance residual on `join_segments`, outside the flatten-site separator ruling.
- Caching, offline, disk cap — **PR 2**; `cache` fields currently inert.
- **Retrieval, not analysis.** The tools return per-version text and `amends`; *version-difference* and *"what changed and why it matters"* are the consumer's to compute, drawn from priors — so a convincing answer on a famous bill (119hr1) can be prior-driven, not tool-driven. No version-diff capability, by design (§17 Group F; settled: no amendment-direction inference).

## H. Process notes

- Two HIGH defects were spec errors, faithfully implemented (§3 assumed every version has a date → A3; §5 never said where `<preamble>` sits → A4). The credential-free V5/V7/V9/V10 were skipped though flagged first, and V5-against-a-real-resolution was the check that would have caught the largest bug.
- The header-separator glyph moved `—`→`·` when measurement showed `—` collides with the corpus's own em-dash use inside quoted segments — the pinned criterion applied to new evidence, not overridden.
- **The verification apparatus caught its own defects, twice.** The A4 fabrication detector was validated with planted good/bad citations *before* its verdict was trusted — and an earlier version of it counted every citation and reported 14.1% against a 10% threshold, measuring cross-references: the exact false-positive class it was built to check, reintroduced as the measurement. Generalized rule, now a convention: *a measurement of a property is subject to the same failure class as the implementation of that property.* Separately, F23 found that the E2E harness could score a run that exercised nothing as clean.
- **The spec's own author was wrong on the record five times this cycle** — a mocked test fixture cited as an observation (F20), defensive machinery for two cases the data ruled out (F20 ranking, F28), a withdrawn carve-out (F23/Haiku), and a fabrication finding retracted once the instrument's scope was applied to it (§17 F3). Each is recorded in place with the correction rather than quietly edited out. The pattern is worth stating plainly for whoever reads these rulings next: the **verifications** held; the **defect-flags** were where the errors clustered.
- **Review scope is part of review validity.** Three of eight findings in one automated review were artifacts of the review branch presenting stale out-of-scope files — true about the slice, false about the software. Recorded in `../tool-defect-register.md`; the durable fix is to review a diff, not a worktree.

## Gates — what is closed, and what is honestly still open

- [x] **§17 re-run executed** — `2026-08-15T033553Z`, build `9224726` (all fixes ancestors), complete four-cell run. **Group A 16/16 PASS (merge gate met)**; fixes confirmed at consumer (F2/D5, F11/C3, segment-`amends`/Group A incl. Haiku, B1-CHUNK, version/E3). Open: Group F verbatim+isolation gap (indicative only); consumer-side D4 caveat gap and `PRE:`/`S:` id leakage (model behavior, not tool defects). See §E. *(F3/ceiling "fabrication" retracted — untraced-sibling, unverifiable.)*
- [ ] **F16** dispositioned — **one measurement, not a defect**: confirm F4's struck-text carve-out drops the `#2` collision suffix to zero on `119s4726rs`, then decide the residual question (*should a silently-applied disambiguation be silent?* — a mechanism that quietly resolves an anomaly prevents anyone from learning the anomaly occurred). Does not block merge on the stated §17 rule; it is an owed confirmation of a fix already shipped.
- [x] **Cosmetic residuals dispositioned.** `quotes_seen` — **resolved by measurement**: it is dead state (initialized, never mutated, never read), so *removal* is correct rather than population; routed as nit #30. `cache` `false`→`null` — **open, PR 2**, and worth doing before then: this spec's own author twice read the inert `false` as a measurement. `S 3548`'s orphaned `" .` — **explained**: not a source delimiter (V16 measured those at 0.0%), a spacing artifact, superseded by the F12/F18 delimiter work.
- [x] **Every `[ ]` above is filled or deliberately marked out-of-scope**, and the two items that remain open are named rather than folded into prose.
- [x] **Cross-vendor row recorded (non-gating)** — six adjudications, F29/F32/F33 closed, F30 settled at effect level; response shape vindicated at the cross-vendor floor, adoption findings and the danger ladder recorded. See §E.
- [x] **F31 live keyless verification** — **CLOSED 2026-08-21**, live-verified by the spec session post-merge: scrubbed-env call → `api_key_missing` naming both variables; `govinfo_key_rejected` absent. (§18 F31 entry.)
- [ ] **Requirements calls: two of three answered** — **F27 RESOLVED 2026-08-20** (converge on §9's envelope server-wide, after PR 2 — ruling at the F27 entry, §18); **#4 RESOLVED 2026-08-20** (vestigial — delete; the version-discovery capability it gestured at is a recorded PR-2 requirement, §3 "Version discovery — requirement recorded 2026-08-20"; delete tracked as D12); **#17 OPEN** (does the pinned-version pre-validation round-trip earn its better error message?). Not merge blockers.
- [ ] **Group F's verbatim-sourcing gap.** The six questions used were derived by someone who had read this spec, and were not run in the isolated cell — the manifest self-flags them as indicative only. Replace with verbatim questions from naive sources **and** run them in isolation before any Group F finding is recorded as a measurement. This is the one §17 gap the re-run did not close.
